To solve sub-qubo problems on the ising solver you will need to invoke qbsolv with `sudo`.

================
New qbsolv args
================
-I
If present, use ising chip to solve sub-problems.

-z numSamples
Number of solutions to sample from ising chip.

-p preSearchPassFactor
Scale the amount of classical tabu search to be performed before decomposing problem to
sub-problems.

-g globalSearchPassFactor
Scale the amount of classical tabu search to be performed between each round of sub-problem
solutions.

-d
Final output will be printed as comma delimited data, allowing for aggregation of multiple runs in a
single data file.


=========
Examples:
=========

$ ./qbsolv -I -i ./data/bqp100_5.qubo

$ ./qbsolv -p 100 -g 200 -z 5 -I -i ./data/bqp100_5.qubo

======
Output
======
Delimited output has the format:

input file name, preSearchPassFactor, globalSearchPassFactor, final energy, Number of subproblems
solved, pre search tabu time, global search tabu time, Time solving subproblems, total time, prng seed


Eg:
$ sudo ./qbsolv -I -d -r 321 -m -p 0 -g 100 -i ./data/bqp500_2.qubo
./data/bqp500_2.qubo  0  100  128339.0 192    0.0000   1.3830   4.5385   5.9957 321
